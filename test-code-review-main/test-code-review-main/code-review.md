## 1. Global mutable state
What's happening:
A global Map and waitingIntervalId counter are used to track timeouts.

Why it matters:
Globals can be risky, they might lead to bugs if multiple parts of your app use this module or if the module is imported more than once.

Suggestion:
Consider wrapping this state in a class or closure to contain it and prevent unexpected side effects.

## 2. Destructive timeout array
What's happening:
The function getLastUntilOneLeft uses pop() on the timeouts array, which permanently removes elements from it.

Why it matters:
This can be surprising to anyone using your function. They might not expect the original array to be modified, which could lead to unintended consequences.

Suggestion:
Either work on a copy of the array or clearly document that the array will be modified by the function.

## 3. Parameter passing in the internal handlr
What's happening:
In internalHandler, you call the callback with handler(argsInternal). This passes a single array as an argument instead of spreading the arguments.

Why it matters:
If your intention is to forward multiple arguments to the handler, the current approach won't work as expected.

Suggestion:
Change the call to handler(...argsInternal) to pass the arguments individually.

## 4. Type safety and naming
What's happening:
The handler is typed as a generic function, which doesn't enforce any particular signature or behavior.

Why it matters:
This lack of specificity can make the code less safe and harder to understand or maintain.

Suggestion:
Define a more specific type for handler (e.g. a function signature that matches your expectations). Also, consider renaming waitingIntervalId to something like intervalIdCounter for clarity.

## 5. Browser dependency
What's happening:
The code uses window.setTimeout, which ties it to a browser environment.

Why it matters:
If you ever need to run this in a non-browser context (like Node.js), it might not work as intended.

Suggestion:
If cross-environment compatibility is a goal, look into alternatives or abstractions that work both in browsers and other environments.
